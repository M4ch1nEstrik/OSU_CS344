To run this program, extract all files in the same directory, then type in "make" to create the executable. Once compiled, run via "./line_processor". You can also have bash redirect stdin or stdout by adding command line arguments when running a file. For example, to redirect stdin to testinput.txt and stdout to testoutput.txt, run as "./line_processor < testinput.txt > testoutput.txt". If no command line arguments, the program will use the default (terminal).
